# AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application

## Business Overview
In the B2B (Business-to-Business) environment, businesses often engage in transactions on credit terms. When a buyer places an order with a seller, the seller issues an invoice that contains details of the goods and payment terms. This process is called **Accounts Receivable** in accounting.

This project aims to develop an **AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application** using **Java** and **React.js**. The application is designed to streamline the invoice management process by providing features such as credit validation, order verification, inventory checks, and order amount prediction.
